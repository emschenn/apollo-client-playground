## An `apollo-client` Playground

just a simple todo list to play and try out `apollo-client`:

- created with Create React App (CRA)
- uses [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for data fetching and management 🚀
- utilizes [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and its serverless API for data storage and CRUD ⚡️
- styled with [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Mesher](https://csshero.org/mesher/) for the gradient background 🎨
